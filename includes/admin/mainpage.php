		<h2>Product Catalog 8</h2>
		<p>Thank you for installing Product Catalog 8.
		It is currently a simple product catalog that allows management of products with an easy to use backend system.
		I have many improvements in the works and I have many ideas to enhance and add more features to the plugin.
		</p>
		<p>
		This plugin will be updated a lot in it's early stages, here is what's next:
		<ul class="pc8-list">
			<li>Multiple Catalogs at once</li>
			<li>Spreadsheet Upload/Download</li>
			<li>Product Search</li>
			<li>Product Pages</li>
			<li>Multiple Images per Product</li>
			<li>Fancybox integration</li>
			<li>More layouts</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Getting this plugin working is easy</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create Product Categories</li>
			<li>Create Product Sub-Categories</li>
			<li>Create Products</li>
			<li>Add shortcode [catalog-8] to any page.</li>
		</ol>	
	<p>Categories and Subcategories aren't required, and you can do the above steps in any order, but this will require the least amount of steps.</p>
